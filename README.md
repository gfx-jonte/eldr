# ðŸ”¥Eldr: Physically Based Renderer
## Introduction
_Eldr_ ("fire" in Old Norse) is my new hobby project. After working with [_Mitsuba 2_](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba2) in my master's thesis [project](https://github.com/gfx-jonte/PPG-quadtree-reconstruction), I was inspired to create something similar on my own to learn more about computer graphics. In contrast to Mitsuba, I intend to make Eldr more GUI oriented, making it possible to set up scenes as you go, and provide more immediate visual feedback like most commercial renderers do. However, I want to keep the "research spirit" of Mitsuba, making it as modular as I can to allow swapping out components and trying new rendering techniques. This is essential for me as the purpose of this project is for me to learn about rendering.

I will try to keep cross platform compatibility in mind while developing Eldr, but it is not a priority in the beginning. I will be developing on Linux and the build instructions etc. will therefore be Linux(debian)-oriented to begin with.

## Requirements
The following software is available on Windows as well, so it should be possible to build there as well. Note that MSVC 2013 is not compatible with [cxxopts](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts#requirements).
```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential ninja-build meson python3 python3-pip clang \
    python3-setuptools python3-wheel libspdlog-dev libglfw3-dev libglm-dev libvulkan-dev
```
For debugging:
```
sudo apt install vulkan-validationlayers-dev spirv-tools
```

## Build
### App
```
$ meson setup build
$ cd build
$ ninja
```
### Shaders
I have been using [glslc](https://github.com/google/shaderc) to compile some basic shaders. Eldr will look for the compiled shaders `vert.spv` and `frag.spv` in `resources`. `compileShaders.sh` will compile the `src/shaders/shader.(vert|frag)` and put the corresponding `.spv` files in `resources`.
